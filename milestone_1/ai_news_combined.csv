ieee_spectrum,Nokia Bell Labs Breaks Ground for Its New N.J. Headquarters,"Nokia Bell Labs has a lot to celebrate. The research giant marked its 100th anniversary in May at its venerable campus in Murray Hill—part of New Providence, N.J.—where major technological developments have occurred, such as the Bellmac-32 microprocessor and the satellite Earth station known as the Horn Antenna, which helped prove the big bang theory.The company also held a groundbreaking ceremony on 4 September for its new headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J., about 32 kilometers south of Murray Hill and 10 km from IEEE’s Piscataway office.Construction of the 10-story, 34,374-square-meter building is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2027. The Health and Life Science Exchange 2 building, known as HELIX 2, is the second of three planned edifices being constructed in the city’s new innovation district, which is designed to attract research labs, workspaces, and office suites for startups. Attendees at the ceremony included Thierry E. Klein, the Bell Labs solutions research president, and Peter Vetter, the Bell Labs core research president. Both men are IEEE Fellows. New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, was there too, as were New Brunswick Mayor James Cahill and other state and local officials.“Today’s groundbreaking marks a new and exciting chapter in Bell Labs’ long history in New Jersey,” Klein said. “As we build and move into the HELIX, this continues our legacy of excellence, pioneering spirit, and commitment to breakthrough research on the East Coast. The location offers unique advantages that will accelerate our innovation capabilities and provide greater proximity to academic centers of excellence and fantastic new startups and ventures.”The new location, he said, “will give access to a vibrant and urban environment that will help us attract the next generation of talent. Access to universities such as Princeton, Rutgers, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and the Stevens Institute of Technology is incomparable. This is not just a move for the next two, three, four, or five years; this is going to be home for Bell Labs for a very, very long time.”A hub of innovationNokia Bell Labs could have relocated its headquarters anywhere in the world, Murphy noted, but it chose to remain in New Jersey.“Our illustrious history of innovation in New Jersey could be summarized in two words: Bell Labs,” the governor said. “For over a century, Bell Labs has transformed our state, our nation, and the world. This is literally an iconic and globally unique institution. We break ground and start to establish a new foundation for quantum physics, generative artificial intelligence, and optical communications. Through partnerships, joint ventures, and spinoffs, Nokia Bell Labs will facilitate new products and companies that will [continue to] drive the innovation economy in New Jersey.”To ensure New Jersey would be at the forefront of innovation, the governor in 2018 announced his intent to establish 12 innovation hubs throughout the state as a way to attract entrepreneurs, startups, and early-stage companies. The first hub—the HELIX 1 building, adjacent to Nokia Bell Labs’ new headquarters—is expected to open next year and include Rutgers’s medical school and translational research institute. New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, at the podium addresses attendees at the groundbreaking ceremony. NokiaThe facilities will offer furnished offices and labs outfitted with scientific equipment, officials say. Tenants will include Hackensack Meridian Health and Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health.New Brunswick is no stranger to innovators, Cahill noted. The Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company is headquartered in the city and got its start in a local wallpaper factory. The Johnson brothers and Thomas Edison often ate at a nearby drugstore lunch counter, where they discussed advancements in manufacturing, the mayor said. Edison’s laboratory was in Menlo Park. Cahill also said that Albert Einstein, who worked at Princeton University and lived in the town, was often spotted strolling the streets of New Brunswick, about 30 km away.State-of-the-art research facilitiesThe new Nokia Bell Lab offices will cater to the needs of research scientists and specialists in focused areas, Klein said.“It’s an efficient, modern, and low-carbon facility providing sustainable power, heating, and cooling capabilities,” he said. “Our researchers will have access to the best facility possible. That is our dream.”This is not the first time Bell Labs has moved its headquarters, Vetter noted. The primary R&D activities were set up in New York City in 1925. They moved to Murray Hill in 1941. Some of the biggest innovations were developed there during the following decade, including the transistor and the cellular network.“I want to think that our move will again be a catalyst for breakthrough innovations to happen in the decade after we move in and will be in a variety of areas such as 7G, AI, quantum computing, and quantum network security,” Vetter said.“As we build and move into the HELIX, this continues our legacy of excellence, pioneering spirit, and commitment to breakthrough research on the East Coast.” —Thierry Klein“We also need to make sure the research goes into the real world,” he said. “We like to say that if somebody has a problem in the real world and you solve it in the lab but you don’t make that leap of technology into the real world, the problem still exists.“It’s not just research or breakthrough technologies,” he added. “It’s also creating the companies that will commercialize these technologies and lead the next century of innovation.”IEEE Milestones recognize Bell Labs innovationsAnother celebratory event is scheduled for 21 October in Murray Hill. Several technologies developed there are to be designated as IEEE Milestones. The technologies include three Nobel Prize winners: super-resolved microscopy, the charge-coupled device, and the fractional quantum hall effect. IEEE Region 1 and the IEEE North Jersey Section sponsored the nominations.Administered by the IEEE History Center and supported by donors, the Milestones program recognizes outstanding technical developments around the world.Watch for The Institute’s article on the Nokia Bell Labs Milestone achievement ceremony in November.",https://spectrum.ieee.org/nokia-bell-labs-new-headquarters,2025-10-14 18:00:03

koreatimes,NBA turns to AI and cameras to improve officiating accuracy,"The play, in real time to the naked eye, might have looked very close to a violation. LeBron James leaped, got his right hand on the ball with a few tenths of the game’s final second remaining and tapped it through the basket to give the Los Angeles Lakers a buzzer-beating win last season. Referees on the floor called it correctly. Video replay backed up their call, and the Lakers got a victory over the Indiana Pacers. Turns out, it wasn’t close at all. The NBA has a relatively new tool called “automated officiating,” and the robotic eyes that are now tracking just about everything on basketball courts showed that James was nowhere near committing offensive basket interference on that play. It wasn’t needed to decide matters in that case — again, the humans got it right — but the NBA is tapping into technology more and more to ensure that plays like those get adjudicated correctly. “Turns out, computers are really good at this,” said Evan Wasch, an NBA executive vice president overseeing basketball strategy and analytics. “So, if we can invest in this technology to ge",https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/world/20251015/nba-turns-to-ai-and-cameras-to-improve-officiating-accuracy,2025-10-14 17:17:03

Pakistani IT companies with subsidiaries and joint ventures in various countries are also participating in the trade fair, according to the exhibitors.Muhammad Umair Nizam, Senior Vice Chairman of the Pakistan Software Houses Association (PASHA), said Pakistani IT companies are participating in large numbers at GITEX Dubai this year because of the business response they received from their presence at the trade fair last year.Smoke and screen: forget hosting GITEX, make Pakistan friendly for IT sector first“GITEX Global in Dubai is the only trade fair where Pakistani IT companies make their largest collective presence outside Pakistan every year, similar to their participation in ITCN Asia in Pakistan,” he mentioned.“We are optimistic that Pakistan’s IT companies will not only attract clients from the Gulf region but also from developed countries across the world,” PASHA vice chairman added.The Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) and TechDestination have set up a Pakistan Pavilion featuring 26 leading IT companies and 10 startups to highlight software exports, artificial intelligence, and new-age technologies. The authorities have also established networking areas, such as the Connexons Lounge to facilitate Pakistani exhibitors in business-to-business meetings.Muhammad Zohaib Khan, an exhibitor from Pakistan and former Chairman of PASHA, said Pakistan’s government and trade authorities are focusing on countries in the Gulf region to enhance IT exports to non-traditional markets.“Pakistan’s exports of IT and IT-enabled services are increasing in the Gulf, mainly in countries with mega economic plans like Vision 2030 and Vision 2035, which are based on digital transformation. However, there remains enormous potential to multiply our IT service exports manifold to these countries,” he further said.To engage with major clients, Pakistani tech companies have decided to form joint ventures at the local level, and their large-scale participation reflects their passion to work collectively under the auspices of the relevant authorities, according to Khan.Besides private-sector IT companies, a few public-sector entities are also participating at GITEX Dubai, including the National IT Board (NITB) and Pakistan’s National Computer Emergency Response Team (NCERT). Minister of IT and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima has also scheduled memorandum of understanding (MoU) signings and government-to-government (G2G) meetings at the event.Saad Shah, another exhibitor and CEO of Hexalyze, said Pakistani IT companies are shifting their business strategy from the traditional US market toward emerging Gulf countries as part of their expansion plans. “Hence, GITEX Global provides a platform for local IT companies to expand their export business portfolios not only in the Gulf region but across the world,” he noted.He suggested that Pakistani IT companies could attract trade buyers from the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa through significant participation at GITEX Global by showcasing their products, solutions, and services.“With the increasing participation of Pakistani IT companies each year, it is hoped that local firms will continue to explore new clients and diversify their export outreach, ultimately translating their efforts into higher export earnings,” he remarked.GITEX Global, one of the world’s largest tech and startup shows, is hosting its 45th edition at the Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC), featuring 6,500 exhibitors, 1,800 startups, and 1,200 investors from over 180 countries.",https://www.brecorder.com/news/40387372/pakistans-100-it-companies-and-1000-delegates-participate-in-gitex-global-in-dubai,2025-10-14 17:08:53

businessobserverfl,USF receives $2.3M for cybersecurity college,"The University of South Florida announced Tuesday that it has received $2.3 million in private donations for its newest college, the Bellini College of Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Computing.The announcement came during the university’s inaugural CyberBay conference — a three-day event that aims to bring together leaders in the technology, academic, government and military sectors for conversations on cybersecurity, national security and artificial intelligence. USF President Rhea Law opened the conference by announcing that she has made a personal donation of $1 million to the new Bellini College, which was matched by her friends and fellow philanthropists Kate Tiedemann and Ellen Cotton. In addition to that $2 million gift, tech entrepreneur Arnie Bellini and his wife, Lauren Bellini, are donating $300,000 to the college that bears their name, specifically for its students, faculty and staff to conduct cybersecurity research and provide recommendations on how to better protect government computer systems in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater. Arnie Bellini is the founder and CEO of Bellini Capital and founder of ConnectWise, a business management software company based in Tampa. He is also a USF alum, having completed his MBA in Finance at the university in 1981.“AI and cybersecurity not only safeguard our data and infrastructure, they also drive innovation and are key to the future success of our university and the Tampa Bay region,” Law says in the statement. “We are at a pivotal moment in history and thanks to partners and friends like the Bellinis, we are investing in the next generation of leaders — those who will shape the future of cybersecurity, technology and our global economy.”In March, the Bellinis set a new record for the university by donating $40 million to fund the new college, named in their honor. At the same time, the couple also launched the “Bellini Challenge” by agreeing to match every additional dollar donated to the college up to $5 million. The $2 million in gifts announced Tuesday qualify toward that effort, the university says in a statement. In addition to making the largest single financial gift in USF’s 69 year history, the Bellini’s gave the university $11 million in 2022 to establish the Bellini Center for Talent Development at USF’s Muma College of Business. Tiedemann and Cotton, of St. Petersburg, are also long-time supporters of USF. The Bellini College opened this fall with more than 3,000 students and is the first named college in the nation devoted to both the study of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The college’s mission is three-fold: to deliver high-demand academic programs, advance excellence in research and promote ethical use of AI and cybersecurity to foster social good.",https://businessobserverfl.com/news/2025/oct/14/usf-receives-23-million-for-bellini-college-of-ai-cybersecurity-and-computing/,2025-10-14 16:52:00
